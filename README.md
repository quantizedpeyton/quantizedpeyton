# About me!

- Hi! My name is Peyton. I'm currently 15, and working on learning many things, such as code, to work towards my beloved goal of becoming a Qauntum researcher.
- My interests are physics, art, and anything and everything! How could someone not be curious about the world, when we as a whole know so very little?
- I enjoy making art! I lean more towards a realistic artstyle. I'd like to use art to learn and teach concepts simply, for myself and others!
- Timid, but always ready to learn.
- Metal, rock, alt, indie, etc. lover for life..(which surprises some people!) always there for the OGs.
- I like purple, cats, and sweet things. What else could someone want?
- JoJo's lover.
- 🐈‍⬛ Is the cat in the box okay?
